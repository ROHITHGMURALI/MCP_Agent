# MCP Tool Generator (Python)

This project is a Python implementation of the MCP Tool Generator, a system for generating development tools from API specifications.

## Overview

The system ingests heterogeneous API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL/gRPC/Postman/AsyncAPI), normalizes them into a rigorous Intermediate Representation (IR), and generates production-ready MCP tool bundles, runtimes, tests, docs, mocks, and governance.

This Python implementation is a fresh start, focusing on a clean and robust architecture.
