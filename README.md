# MCP_Agent
AI-assisted (but deterministic-first) system that ingests heterogeneous API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL/gRPC/Postman/AsyncAPI), normalizes them into a rigorous Intermediate Representation (IR), and generates production‑ready MCP tool bundles, runtimes, tests, docs, mocks, and governance.
